Trident MongoDB integration library
===============
This library implements a Trident state on top of MongoDB. It supports non-transactional, transactional, and opaque state types. It is highly inspired on the [trident-memcached](https://github.com/nathanmarz/trident-memcached) project.

Current state is not yet release worthly, and requires the 0.8.1-wip2-SNAPSHOT of the [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) project to compile.

The only other dependencies are the mongo-java-driver and [jongo](http://jongo.org).

Feel free to comment, suggest or collaberate!

Many thanks to [Nathan Marz](https://github.com/nathanmarz) for creating the excellent [Storm project](http://storm-project.net)
